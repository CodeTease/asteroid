# Game Modes & Progression

Asteroid Destroyer features a distinct phased progression system. As the player survives and defeats major bosses, the game evolves into new modes with unique mechanics and challenges.

## 1. Normal Mode (0-300s)

The standard survival experience. Players start with basic weaponry and must survive against standard asteroid types and basic enemies. The primary goal is to upgrade weapons, acquire allies, and prepare for the first major encounter.

*   **Duration:** 0 to 300 seconds (Global Time).
*   **Enemies:** Standard Asteroids, Scouts, Brutes, Shooters.
*   **Objective:** Survive until the timer reaches 300s to summon the **Initial Final Boss**.

## 3. Void Mode: Extended (150-300s Void Time)

**Unlocked By:** Defeating the **Behemoth** (Mini-Boss).

**Phase Description:**
Defeating the Behemoth pushes the game into "Extended" Void Mode. This phase introduces environmental hazards and complex defense mechanics.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Void Barrier:** A defensive shield appears around the player. It must be maintained to survive.

## 4. Void Mode: Crisis (300-600s Void Time)

**Unlocked By:** Defeating the **Monolith**.

**Phase Description:**
Known as "Five Minutes of Hell", this is the ultimate survival challenge. The game rules themselves begin to break down, forcing the player to adapt to chaotic shifting conditions.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Barrier Cap:** The Void Barrier is capped at 50% integrity.
    *   **Crisis Events:** Randomly occurring global mutators:
        *   *Drift:* Forced player movement, making precision difficult.

        *   *Chaos Target Lock:* Allies become confused and may target erratically.
    *   **New Enemies:** Breachers (fast, anti-barrier units) and Brick Walls (massive passive blockers).
*   **Objective:** Survive the chaos to face the final challenge: the **Afterimage Boss**.
